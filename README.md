# SlimPy

SlimPy is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator application that helps users calculate their BMI based on their height and weight inputs. It categorizes the BMI into different weight status categories such as underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity.

## Description

Users can input their name, height, and weight, and the application calculates their BMI along with their weight status category. It also maintains a history of BMI calculations for reference and allows users to visualize BMI trends over time.
